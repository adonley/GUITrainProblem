Java Solution to the ThoughtWorks - Train Problem [GUI version]
******************************************

Compiled and built with JDK 6 using eclipse

Needed to use more interfaces with the swing GUI for this project. There are a lot of copied functions amongst the GUI classes.
Also, LinkedHashSet was not the best data structure used to store nodes.
