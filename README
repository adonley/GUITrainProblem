Java Solution to the ThoughtWorks - Train Problem [GUI version]
******************************************

Compiled and built with JDK 6 using eclipse
The documentation PDF contains usage and algorithm details.

=======
Things that could have been done better:
Needed to use more interfaces with the swing GUI for this project. 
There are a lot of copied functions amongst the GUI classes.
Also, LinkedHashSet was not the best data structure used to store nodes.
